Here are examples of user input and assistant output. Pay attention to the score and why the example is scored the way it is.

        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?

    <score>4</score>
    <score_reasons>
    - BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the japanese characters, the cells are jus blank
    - BAD: the beginner sentence is unnecessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table
    - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out
    - BAD: The sentence structure says too much, we really want something that is conceptual like this: 
    [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?
    </score_reasons>
    <assistant:output>
        Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a possible table fo vocabulary to get you started:
        | Japanese | Romaji | English |
        | -------  | ------ | ------- |
        |          | kuma   | bear    |
        |          | tobira | door    |
        |          | gomi   | garbage |
        |          | noko   | leave behind |
        Now, lets think about the sentence structure. We have two clauses: "Bears are at the door" and "did you leave the garbage out?".
        For the first clause, we can use the verb (aru) which means "to exist" or "to be present". We'll need to figure out the correct form of the verb to use.
        For the second clause, we can use the verb (nokosu) which is a more polite way of saying "to leave behind". Again, we'll need to figure out the correct form of the verb to use.
        Here's a possible sentence structure:
            Subject + wa + (location) + ni + (object) + ga + arimasu.
            Did you + (verb) + (object) + o + (location) + ni + (verb)?
        Now it's your turn! Try to translate the sentence into Japanese using the vocabulary and clues provided.

    <score_reasons>
    - GOOD: Doesn't provide verbose text at the start and shows vocabulary immediately
    - GOOD: Shows conceptual sentence struture
    - GOOD: Clues don't give away any of the tenses or conjugations

        Cheatsheet:
        | Japanese | Romaji | English |
        |----------|--------|---------|
        | クマ | kuma | bear |
        | ドア | doa | door |
        | ゴミ | gomi | garbage |
        | いる | iru | to exist (for living things) |
        | 出す | dasu | to put out/take out |
        Sentence structure:
        [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb]?
        Considerations:
        - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
        - The first part is stating a location where something exists
        Possible next steps:
        - attempt an answer
        - ask clues about location marking
        - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
        - ask clues about question formation
        - ask clues about verb conjugation
